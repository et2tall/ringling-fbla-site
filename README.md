# The Ringling (FBLA Demo) — Website Project

This folder contains a simple multi-page website that matches the FBLA **Exploring Website Design** required elements for the 2025–2026 topic:
**“Culture on Display: Create a Museum or Gallery Website.”**

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home page + navigation menu
- `exhibitions.html` — Calendar/list of upcoming exhibitions (sample layout)
- `featured.html` — Featured artists/artifacts “product cards”
- `visit.html` — Visitor information (hours, address, ticket guidance)
- `sources.html` — Research citations / sources used

## How to run
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
   - Works offline (no external dependencies).

## Customization (for higher scores)
- Replace the sample exhibitions with current listings from The Ringling’s official site.
- Add 2–3 more featured cards (or use your own photos).
- Add a small “About” section with your team’s design process (wireframe → color palette → testing).
- Practice your 7-minute presentation: walk through user goals, navigation, and research.

## Notes
- This site is a student demo and is not affiliated with The Ringling.
